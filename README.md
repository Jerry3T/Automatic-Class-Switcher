# Automatic-Class-Switcher
NOTE: CURRENTLY, TO CHANGE YOUR URLS OR TIMES, YOU HAVE TO DELETE THE FILE CREATED BY THE APPLICATION. OR IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU CAN EDIT IT DIRECTLY.
PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THE NUMBER AT THE TOP OF THE FILE, YOU CAN CHANGE THE REST OF THE URLS/TIMES THOUGH. THEY SHOULD BE ORDERED CHRONOLOGICALLY AND IN BLOCK NUMBER ORDER 
(EX. 1-8). 

Source code is in the py file, executable is in the class_switcher zip file. Don't worry about the other files, just open exe, I did this because dumb
Windows Defender kept deleting my damn stupid executables. Screw you Bill Gates

Put in your Google Meet URLS & the times for each class/block (pls use 24 hrs format ex. 15:03). It will automatically take you to the meeting so you don't have to type in.

When you put in your times + urls, they're stored in the "dumpfile.txt" file. This is so you don't have type them in everytime.

I would recommend placing the executable in a folder so that when the file is created, they both are already organized.

Thanks for using
