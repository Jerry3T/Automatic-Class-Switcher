# Automatic-Class-Switcher

Source code is in the py file, executable for people who don't have Python installed.

Put in your Google Meet URLS & the times for each class/block (pls use 24 hrs format ex. 15:03). It will automatically take you to the meeting so you don't have to type in

When you put in your times + urls, they're stored as lists in 4 files (adayurls, bdayurls, adaytimes, bdaytimes) based on those variables. 
This is so you don't have type them in everytime.

I would recommend placing the executable in a folder so that when the files are created they're already organized.

Thanks for using
